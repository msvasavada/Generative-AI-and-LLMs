weeks and around 89% of Switch owners were estimated to have also purchased the game.[52] Sales of the game have remained strong and as of June 30, 2022, the Switch version has sold 27.14 million copies worldwide while the Wii U version has sold 1.69 million copies worldwide as of December 31, 2019,[53][54] giving Breath of the Wild a cumulative total of 28.83 million copies sold.\\n It also earned a Metacritic score of 97 from more than 100 critics, placing it among the highest-rated games of all time.[59][60] Notably, the game received the most perfect review scores for any game listed on Metacritic up to that point.[61]\\nIn 2022, Breath of the Wild was chosen as the best Legend of Zelda game of all time in their \"Top 10 Best Zelda Games\" list countdown; but was then placed as the \"second\" best Zelda game in their new revamped version of their \"Top 10 Best Zelda Games\" list in 2023, right behind it\\'s successor Tears of Video Game Canon ranks Breath of the Wild as one of the best video games of all time.[74] Metacritic ranked Breath of the Wild as the single best game of the 2010s.[75]\\nFan Reception[]\\nWatchMojo placed Breath of the Wild at the #2 spot in their

'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild', 'score': 0.9570375, 'images': []}, page_content='Reviewers also commented on the unexpected permutations of interactions between Link, villagers, pets, and enemies,[129][130][131] many of which were shared widely on social media.[132] A tribute to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who died during development, also attracted praise.[129][134]\\nJim Sterling was more critical than most, giving Breath of the Wild a 7/10 score, criticizing the difficulty, weapon durability, and level design, but praising the open world and variety of content.[135] Other criticism focused on the unstable frame rate and the low resolution of 900p;[136] updates addressed some of these problems.[137][138]\\nSales\\nBreath of the Wild broke sales records for a Nintendo launch game in multiple regions.[139][140] In Japan, the Switch and Wii U versions sold a combined 230,000 copies in the first week of release, with the Switch version becoming the top-selling game released that week.[141] Nintendo reported that Breath of the Wild sold more than one million copies in the US that month—925,000 of which were for Switch, outselling the Switch itself.[145][146][147][148] Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima said that the attach rate on the Switch was \"unprecedented\".[149] Breath of the Wild had sold 31.15 million copies on the Switch by September 2023 and 1.70 million copies on the Wii U by December 2020.[150][151]\\nAwards\\nFollowing its demonstration at E3 2016, Breath of the Wild received several accolades from the Game Critics Awards[152] and from publications such as IGN and Destructoid.[153][154] It was listed among the best games at E3 by Eurogamer,[81] The game, he continued, would challenge the series\\' conventions, such as the requirement that players complete dungeons in a set order.[2][73] The next year, Nintendo introduced the game\\'s high-definition, cel-shaded visual style with in-game footage at its E3 press event.[74][75] Once planned for release in 2015, the game was delayed early in the year and did not show at that year\\'s E3.[76][77] Zelda series creator Shigeru Miyamoto reaffirmed that the game would still release for the Wii U despite the development of Nintendo\\'s next console, the Nintendo Switch.[78] The Switch version also has higher-quality environmental sounds.[53][54] Certain ideas that were planned for the game, like flying and underground dungeons were not implemented due to the Wii U’s limitations; they would eventually resurface in the game\\'s sequel.[55] Aonuma stated that the art design was inspired by gouache and en plein air art to help identify the vast world.[56] Takizawa has also cited the Jōmon period as an inspiration for the ancient Sheikah technology and architecture that is found in the game, due to the mystery surrounding the period.[57] Journalists commented on unexpected interactions between game elements,[129][130][131] with serendipitous moments proving popular on social media.[132] Chris Plante of The Verge predicted that whereas prior open-world games tended to feature prescribed challenges, Zelda would influence a new generation of games with open-ended problem-solving.[132] Digital Trends wrote that the game\\'s level of experimentation allowed players to interact with and exploit the environment in creative ways, resulting in various \"tricks\" still discovered years after release.[127]\\nReviewers lauded the sense of detail and immersion.[133][129] Kotaku recommended turning off UI elements in praise of the indirect cues that contextually indicate the same information, such as Link shivering in the cold or waypoints appearing when using the scope.[133]')]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install
